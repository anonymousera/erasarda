  <h2><span style="color: #9b4819;">About Era Sarda</span></h2>
  <p>Current Master's student at NYU Courant, and a recent IIT Delhi grad. My pursuit
  is fueled by a deep commitment to discovering meaningful ways to serve
  humanity and lead a life of purpose. My major research and professional interests
  are AI Safety, AI for Social Good, and Mental Health in children and adolescents.
  Would really like to get involved in projects in these fields! My career aspirations
  lie at the intersection of AI Security and Policy. I'm eager to collaborate, discuss,
  or explore project opportunities in this space. Let's connect!</p>
  
  <p>I am an EA Sweden (Effektiv Altruism) member and had one of the top 30 project
  ideas in Indian Network for Impact’s Thinking Competition 2024.  </p>
  
  <p>I idolize Swami Vivekananda. I also get inspired by the impactful work of
  aiforanimals, effectivealtruism, sajhesapne, and many such organizations and
  individuals. But my main motivation is my family who contribute to make several
  lives better with whatever they have. </p>

  <h2><span style="color: #9b4819;">Background</span></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Education: 
        <ul>
          <li>MS Computer Science, New York University (Courant), 2025-26 </li>
          <li>B.Tech. Mathematics & Computing, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, 2020-2024</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>ETH Zurich - Research Internship – Social Network Analysis. Supervisor: Prof. Ulrik Brandes, PhD Meher Chaitanya</li>
      <li>National Centre for Mathematics – Advanced Instructional School - Algorithmic Graph Theory School at IIT Indore <br>
        The AIS was held from June to July at IIT Indore.  It was a part of ATM Schools (Advanced Training for Mathematics). 
        I highly recommend to whoever is interested in math or theoretical cs to check out information on these schools. 
        The curriculum, faculty, assignments, everything were great.<br> 
        <i>NCM is an inter-institutional collaborative project of the School of Mathematics, TIFR together with the Department of Mathematics, IIT-Bombay.</i>

    <h2><span style="color: #9b4819;">Research Interests</span></h2>
    <p>My undergraduate work revolved mostly around theoretical computer science and core maths - social networks, game theory, computational
      biology, functional analysis, FPT algorithms. But eventually I have found my passion in AI Safety and psychology, and I am ready to drive my career
      around it.  Links to some of my projects can be found on github.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>AI Safety:</strong>My more inclination is towards Technical AI Governance and Policy work though, 
        but I would definitely like to work in other fields of AI Safety like Red-teaming (CAMARA Project) , 
        Scalable Oversight (I am very interested in improving AI debate methodology in this).</li> 
      <li><strong>AI for Social Good:</strong>I want to use the advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning for solving 
        social problems such as suicide prevention, women safety, child abuse. The book 
        Impact of AI on Advancing Women's Safety and the report It’s Everyone’s Problem: Mainstreaming Responses to Technology-Facilitated Gender-Based Violence 
        provide different perspectives on how AI can positively and negatively impact women’s safety. 
        I would really love to get involved in projects relating to the issue!</li>
      <li><strong>Mental Health & Child Psychology:</strong> Bad mental health not only leads to financial crises, physical pains, and overall low life satisfaction, 
        but also is a major reason for criminal behavior. “Social learning theory suggests that people who are traumatized in childhood or 
        grow up in violent environments are more likely to mimic and internalize these behaviors and subsequently exhibit violent behavior themselves.” 
        Given the rising crime rate in contemporary society, addressing such psychological issues from a very young age becomes very important.
        I am interested in working on increasing the awareness about the importance of good mental health of children, 
        and related projects. Please feel free to reach out if you are aware of/working on/want to start any such projects!</li>

    <h2><span style="color: #9b4819;">Outside of Academia</span></h2>
    <p><strong>Travel:</strong> I love traveling, specially the unplanned trips! I am not a great photographer though, which
        un-abled me to “properly” capture those
        magnificent moments in the mountains of
        Rohtang, morning Ganga aarti at the
        Dashashwamedh ghat at Varanasi, Eiffel
        tower in Paris or the Grand Canal in Venice ;( <br> My first task before packing for the next trip
        is to learn to click proper pictures ;D</p>
    <p><strong>Novel Reading:</strong> I read books of multiple genres - spiritual, psychological, biographies,
        fantasies. But my all time fav are murder mysteries. <br> I can read for hours sitting at one of the corners of my house and finish
        any size mystery novel in a day. <br> I love writings of Dan Brown, Agatha Christie, Artemis Fowl series, and
        many more. But my favourite series will always be the cute (atleast I think)
        Secret Seven. <br> Highly recommend - A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder (all 3 parts), And Then
        There Were None, Elephant’s Can Remember, Inferno, Mystery Series (by
        Enid Blyton), Swami Vivekananda on Institution Building & Management,  How I quit Google to Sell Samosas </p>
    <p><strong>Blogging:</strong> Not much of a blogger, but wrote two blogs in the past, one of them
        was accepted by Voice of Youth by
        UNICEF. You can find my profile here!<br> (Another one was on
        FifthDimensionWeb website, which unfortunately was closed and I couldn’t retrive my blog ;( )</p>

  <section id="resources">
    <h2><span style="color: #9b4819;">Resource Gallery</span></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>TOEFL Prep (105/120): <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/110-toefl-ibt-score-5-days-mahdi-barkhordari" target="_blank">LinkedIn post</a>- It follows 
        the old TOEFL pattern, but the resources given are still
        very useful. Also do utilize all the free material available on ets website for the prep. They also
        provide around 20 free sample writing questions with scoring. Also try to schedule your toefl only a
        few days or weeks after your GRE. The practice of GRE helps here too. </li>
      <li>GRE Prep (327/340): All official material provided by ETS. <br>
        For Vocab section practice is the key. There always will be a limit on the number of words you can
        remember. 500-800 words should be sufficient. Use smart-work in this case. Choose the most relevant
        ones. I used Barron’s 333 High Frequency Words. Revise daily. Note down the words you didn’t know
        and which came up during practice, especially those from official resources like official GRE Verbal
        Reasoning Practice Questions book. Use elimination technique. The options can be very confusing
        many times, even when you know the word meanings. Therefore, first give your best guess to the
        blanks, then only see the options. DO NOT use the reverse technique. </li>
      <li>Feel free to reach out if you want guidance on summer research internships! I will be adding
          some tips too later. </li>
